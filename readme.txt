Add tags to Pages, just as you would do with Posts 

== Description ==
Add tags to a Page just as you would do with a Post. 

This plugin adds the 'post_tag' taxonomy to the Page post type. 
This enables the tags metabox in the New or Edit Page interface. To show tagged 
Pages on a tags archive page or in a feed, it uses the 'pre_get_posts' hook
to change the post_type query parameter to 'any'. 

The plugin has no settings, does not alter the database and only uses hooks to 
achieve it's goal. It also should work perfectly fine with Multisite installations.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `tag-pages` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!
