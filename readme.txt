Add tags to Pages, just as you would do with Posts 

== Description ==
Add tags to a Page just as you would do with a Post. 

This plugin adds the 'post_tag' taxonomy to the Page post type. 
This enables the tags metabox in the New or Edit Page interface. To show tagged 
Pages on a tags archive page or in a feed, it uses the 'pre_get_posts' hook
to change the post_type query parameter to 'any'. 

The plugin has no settings, does not alter the database and only uses hooks to 
achieve it's goal. It also should work perfectly fine with Multisite installations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Tags are not displayed? =
If you don't see the tags of tagged Pages, make sure your theme supports displaying tags for Pages. 
This plugin does nothing to make tags appear on your website. Tag Pages makes it possible to add tags to your Pages in the WordPress database.  
It is your theme's responsibility to display tags (if any) on your website. Make sure the theme you are using supports displaying tags on Pages.

= Is Gutenberg supported? = 
Yes, <a href='https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/'>the Gutenberg block editor</a> is supported from version 1.0.2 and upwards. 
NB: The <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/'>Classic Editor</a> plugin is also supported.

= Is this plugin actively being developed? =
Yes and no. Let me explain: 
I consider this plugin to be feature complete and unless bugs are found there will be no development on this plugin. In other words this plugin is in maintenance mode and will be maintained for the foreseeable future. 
Due to other obligations I'm not always able to keep up with WordPress version's and updating this readme's 'Tested up to' version number. 
However, unless WordPress significantly changes the way taxonomies work (and breaking backwards compatibility in the process) this plugin should continue to work fine even though the 'Tested up to' might be of a lower version number. 
As always, when in doubt, test it :) (and when it does give you issues, feel free to leave a comment).
